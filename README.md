In this project, we will parse through the IMDB's Top rated Movies page to get details about the top rated movies from around the world.We will retrieve information from the page ’Top Rated Movies’ using web scraping: a process of extracting information from a website programmatically. Web scraping isn’t magic, and yet some readers may grab information on a daily basis. For example, a recent graduate may copy and paste information about companies they applied for into a spreadsheet for job application management.
Project Goal : The project goal is to build a web scraper that will extract all the desirable information and assemble those into a single CSV.
